Vous travaillez ensemble sur la vente, la relation client et l'offre commerciale de votre rayon.

Vous prenez en charge les clients, les écoutez avec attention et cherchez à leur proposer les solutions les plus adaptées à leurs besoins.

Vous mettez les produits en valeur à travers des présentations inspirantes pour les clients.

Grâce à l'analyse de la data, vous identifiez les produits du catalogue Leroy Merlin à proposer à vos clients en magasin, et adaptez les réimplantations de votre rayon.

Vous garantissez la bonne tenue du rayon en assurant la disponibilité des produits, leur rangement, et la visibilité des prix.

- En garantissant la qualité, la propreté et la sécurité de votre rayon,
- En allant chercher l'information, et en participant régulièrement aux formations produits,

Ce que vous retirerez de ce métier ?

Le plaisir de voir vos clients revenir grâce à la relation de confiance que vous aurez créée, et la satisfaction d'atteindre et même dépasser vos objectifs commerciaux.

Et si on regarde plus loin ?

Vous allez pouvoir fabriquer un parcours qui vous ressemble, vraiment. Vous pourrez, par exemple, évoluer vers un poste de Responsable de rayon. Mais vous pourrez aussi changer de domaine métier, en rejoignant les équipes de la Relation Client ou de la Logistique, ou vous engager sur des projets transverses (RSE, chantiers solidaires, etc.).

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.

Bridge est une solution décisionnelle développée en interne pour consolider le chiffre d’affaires des clients qui ont investi dans des campagnes d’affichage sur l'ensemble des Business Units de JCDecaux, présente dans plus de 80 pays. 
Nos objectifs clés pour cette solution sont les suivants : 
Fournir aux directeurs commerciaux des différentes filiales des informations, des études et des alertes pour une meilleure gestion de leur portefeuille clients et la préparation des rendez-vous commerciaux. 
Produire des rapports Corporate sur les investissements destinés à la Direction Générale et à la communication financière externe. 
Actuellement, notre base de données Bridge compte 60 000 annonceurs, avec une croissance mensuelle de 1 500 à 2 500 nouveaux clients référencés. Cette base de données en constante évolution doit garantir une certaine qualité de l’information qualifiée, standardisée, consolidée. 
Missions :
Nous cherchons à recruter un(e) Assistant(e) Data Steward pour nous aider à qualifier les données et améliorer la consolidation de nos investissements. Les missions prioritaires de ce poste incluent : 

Une appétence pour l’actualité socio-économique des entreprises sur un plan international sera un véritable plus. Bien que le poste ne soit pas technique, il peut offrir la possibilité, dans un second temps, de monter en compétence dans la construction de rapports sous Excel connecté au cube de données, ainsi que de fiches clients rassemblant des informations publiques. 
Remarques :
Le collaborateur pourra compter sur le soutien de son manager pour suivre les procédures et les méthodes de traitement les plus appropriées. Un accompagnement sera prévu pour la prise en main des outils fournis, tels que Talend Data Stewardship et CapitalIQ.  
Pour optimiser le processus de qualification des données, une aisance dans l'utilisation de moteurs de recherche, ChatGPT ou la consultation de sites clients est requise. Il est important de noter que ces tâches sont davantage orientées vers la recherche et la collecte d'informations plutôt que vers une mise en œuvre technique.

Au sein du service, votre mission consistera à
• Mener les actions nécessaires pour régulariser les écarts dans nos systèmes d'information, en se basant sur les mesures faites par nos outils d'aide à la décision ou suite au signalement ou à la demande d'un acteur de la supply chain.
• Réaliser les actions de support aux flux nécessitant des rôles / droits plus élevés, tels que les réintégrations de stock.
• Participer à l'analyse causale de l'origine de l'écart, et proposer des modes de détection et/ou de correction préventive.
• (en fonction de vos compétences) Mettre en place les détections
Vous serez accompagnés et en support de 3 personnes expérimentées sur les différents systèmes, qui vous accompagneront dans la montée en connaissance.

Missions, équipe et environnement de travail, ça donne quoi ?

Dans un contexte de numérisation massive de la vie économique et d'augmentation significative du volume d'informations traitées par la banque, maîtriser les données produites et utilisées au sein de BNP Paribas est un objectif stratégique majeur pour le Groupe.

Le Group Data Office a pour mission d'accompagner les différentes priorités en matière de données du Groupe :
- Stratégie de données
- Qualité des données
- Protection des données
- Science des données

Au sein du Group Data Office, l'équipe COO est une équipe polyvalente et multiculturelle localisée à Paris et Madrid. L'équipe travaille en étroite collaboration avec le reste du Group Data Office et de la communauté Data au sens large dans l'ensemble du Groupe.

En tant que Stagiaire Data Project Manager Junior, vous aurez comme missions :
- Participer à la préparation des outils de communication (newsletters, plaquettes de présentation, site web, e-mailing, etc.).
- Conduire des benchmarks sur la base de données internes et externes.
- Participer à des projets sur la qualité des données et le déploiement du dispositif de contrôle autour de la donnée.
- Promouvoir une culture de transformation digitale et de respect des normes réglementaires au sein de la banque.
- Animer la communauté de collaborateurs et créer du contenu pour partager les avancées des projets IA, l'actualité et les interventions.
- Assister les équipes dans l'organisation d'événements internes dédiés à l'acculturation des collaborateurs sur les sujets Data et IA, avec des intervenants internes et externes.
- Aider dans la gestion de projets

Ce stage au sein du Group Data Office vous offrira l'opportunité de plonger au coeur des enjeux stratégiques liés à la data et à l'intelligence artificielle, au sein d'un environnement innovant et en pleine transformation.

En collaborant avec des experts de la donnée, vous développerez des compétences clés et pourrez explorer des perspectives professionnelles enrichissantes dans un domaine en pleine expansion.

Vos perspectives d'évolution ?

Votre passage au sein du Group Data Office vous permet de développer votre expertise et vos compétences techniques, mais également vos capacités de négociation, de travail en équipe, votre esprit de synthèse, tout en élargissant par ailleurs un réseau de relations avec les interlocuteurs du commerce.

D'autres opportunités pourront s'offrir à vous, favorisant votre insertion professionnelle : 
             -   Le Graduate Programme vous permet de booster votre avenir, de développer vos compétences et votre leadership grâce à des missions à responsabilité ;

JCDecaux,"14-01-2025",Assistant Data Steward Janvier ,Stage,Plaisir,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/60568413.html,"Contexte :

Bridge est une solution décisionnelle développée en interne pour consolider le chiffre d'affaires des clients qui ont investi dans des campagnes d'affichage sur l'ensemble des Business Units de JCDecaux, présente dans plus de 80 pays.

Nos objectifs clés pour cette solution sont les suivants :
- Fournir aux directeurs commerciaux des différentes filiales des informations, des études et des alertes pour une meilleure gestion de leur portefeuille clients et la préparation des rendez-vous commerciaux.
- Produire des rapports Corporate sur les investissements destinés à la Direction Générale et à la communication financière externe.

Actuellement, notre base de données Bridge compte 60 000 annonceurs, avec une croissance mensuelle de 1 500 à 2 500 nouveaux clients référencés. Cette base de données en constante évolution doit garantir une certaine qualité de l'information qualifiée, standardisée, consolidée.

Missions :

Nous cherchons à recruter un(e) Assistant(e) Data Steward pour nous aider à qualifier les données et améliorer la consolidation de nos investissements. Les missions prioritaires de ce poste incluent :
- L'attribution des secteurs d'activité à chaque client,
- L'amélioration des rattachements aux entreprises parentes,
- La contribution à la détection des marques concernées par les campagnes publicitaires.

- Une appétence pour l'actualité socio-économique des entreprises sur un plan international sera un véritable plus. Bien que le poste ne soit pas technique, il peut offrir la possibilité, dans un second temps, de monter en compétence dans la construction de rapports sous Excel connecté au cube de données, ainsi que de fiches clients rassemblant des informations publiques.

Remarques :

Le collaborateur pourra compter sur le soutien de son manager pour suivre les procédures et les méthodes de traitement les plus appropriées. Un accompagnement sera prévu pour la prise en main des outils fournis, tels que Talend Data Stewardship et CapitalIQ.
- Pour optimiser le processus de qualification des données, une aisance dans l'utilisation de moteurs de recherche, ChatGPT ou la consultation de sites clients est requise. Il est important de noter que ces tâches sont davantage orientées vers la recherche et la collecte d'informations plutôt que vers une mise en oeuvre technique.
- Un niveau d'anglais minimum est requis, étant donné que la qualification de données peut également impliquer la consultation de sites internet en anglais et en chinois traduit.

CEA,"15-01-2025",Apprentissage Par Transfert Pour Le Diagnostic De Câble Par Réflectométrie,Stage,Saclay,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/58322872.html,"Contexte
La réflectométrie est une méthode de diagnostic qui permet d'identifier et caractériser des défauts électriques sur des câbles ou plus généralement des lignes de transmission. Elle exploite les propriétés physiques de la propagation des ondes dans un milieu, et en l'occurrence un câble. En effet, lorsqu'on y injecte un signal approprié, les variations d'impédance dues à la présence d'un défaut provoquent la naissance d'un signal réfléchi qui peut être exploité pour détecter, localiser et caractériser le défaut. L'analyse de ces défauts permet d'améliorer la maintenance des câbles.
Afin de caractériser finement les défauts, il est nécessaire d'augmenter la bande passante du signal injecté, ce qui pose différents défis lorsque l'analyse doit être exécutée sur un système embarqué ayant des capacités computationnelles limitées.
Une réponse peut y être apportée en utilisant des modèles d'apprentissage automatique allégés et préalablement entraînés pour inférer la présence et les propriétés de défauts sans passer par une chaîne de traitements coûteuses en mémoire et en calculs.
Changement de distribution des données
Cependant, leur précision peut être garantie à condition que les données vues en phase d'inférence suivent la même distribution que les données vues en phase d'entraînement.
En pratique, plusieurs facteurs indépendants de la nature des défauts peuvent affecter la distribution des données : la longueur de câble, les différences de fabrication entre câbles de même type et de même longueur, le type de câble, les contraintes physiques auxquelles est soumis le câble, la fréquence du signal injecté ou encore l'encodage du signal réfléchi dans le convertisseur analogique numérique. De plus, en conditions opérationnelles, on ne dispose d'aucune ou de très peu de données annotées qui permettraient d'entraîner un nouveau modèle à partir de zéro.
L'objectif du stage sera d'évaluer l'impact de ces changements de distribution sur les performances des modèles de détection des défauts et de mettre en oeuvre des stratégies d'apprentissage par transfert permettant de le mitiger.

Déroulement du stage
Les travaux de stage se dérouleront en deux étapes décrites ci-dessous.

Étude exploratoire des variations distributionnelles selon leur origine
Il s'agira à l'aide de techniques de visualisation de caractériser qualitativement les changements de distributions des données dans  différents cas de figure : type de câble, longueur, compression, etc.
Mise en oeuvre et évaluation de trois stratégies d'adaptation de modèles
- Apprentissage avec augmentation de données
- Ré-entraînement partiel de modèle
- Adaptation de domaine
L'objectif sera de proposer une méthodologie qui permette d'obtenir le meilleur compromis entre précision de détection des défauts du modèle adapté et quantité de nouvelles données nécessaires pour l'adaptation du modèle.

CEA,"15-01-2025",Optimisation De La Détection D'émission Acoustiques Pour Le Suivi De La Santé Structurelle À L'aide,Stage,Saclay,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/58322886.html,"Contexte
La surveillance des infrastructures critiques telles que celles du secteur nucléaire ; du génie civil et de l'ingénierie pétrochimique, est essentielle pour garantir leur sécurité et leur intégrité. Elle peut se faire de manière dite passive au moyen des émissions acoustiques (EA) qui sont des ondes produites au sein de la structure par des événements tels que la formations de fissures ou des micro-frictions. Cette approche non intrusive permet une surveillance continue sans nécessité d'arrêts prolongés des opérations, et une détection précoce des anomalies réduisant le risque de défaillances catastrophiques.
La mise en oeuvre de la surveillance par émissions acoustiques présente cependant des challenges importants. Premièrement, les événements d'intérêt sont rares et souvent masqués par un bruit de fond important rendant la détection des formes d'onde recherchée complexe. De ce fait, la surveillance requiert généralement l'enregistrement d'une quantité importante de données ce qui entraîne de fortes contraintes matérielles pour le stockage et la transmission des signaux acquis.
L'objectif principal du stage sera de développer une méthode de segmentation embarquée de signaux de vibrations d'une structure mécanique afin de n'enregistrer que les segments de signaux contenant potentiellement des salves d'émissions acoustiques.
Déroulement du stage
Les travaux de stage se dérouleront en quatre grandes étapes décrites ci-dessous.
Acquisition de données expérimentales contrôlées
A l'aide de la plateforme du département dédiée au suivi de la santé structurelle, des émissions acoustiques seront simulées sur une structure expérimentale et les vibrations induites seront mesurées au moyen de capteur piézo-électrique et du carte d'acquisition dédiée.
Développement d'un modèle de détection d'émissions acoustiques
Une méthode précédemment développée pour la détection d'anomalie dans les séries temporelles sera évaluée, améliorée et adaptée au traitement de données en flux.
Portage sur cible matérielle
Il s'agira d'implémenter le modèle de détection sur la plateforme embarquée dédiée avec des contraintes de mémoire et de puissance. Cela inclut la quantification des paramètres du modèle, l'interfaçage avec l'environnement logiciel de la plateforme embarquée.
Evaluation de la robustesse
La robustesse du modèle face aux variations de distribution des données causées par les capteurs (par exemple un décollage) ou les changements du bruit ambiant sera évaluée et des pistes d'amélioration recommandée.

Safran,"14-01-2025",Suivi En Service Des Trains D'atterrissage Par Des Techniques D'ia,Stage,Vélizy-Villacoublay,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/60584637.html,"Les trains d'atterrissage sont des produits très peu communiquant, mais soumis à des conditions de fonctionnement très différentes en terme d'agressivité.
Afin de mieux comprendre et suivre leur utilisation en service, Safran Landing Systems s'intéresse aux possibilités de suivre à distance les avions équipés de ses produits.
Le stagiaire aura pour mission d'identifier et mettre en forme les données disponibles pour faciliter l'interrogation, analyser des retours en service, mettre en place des modèles pour différentes problématiques (par ex. corrosion).
Vous aurez en charge :
- Analyser les données disponibles et construire un dictionnaire de ces données (source, incertitude...).
- Mettre au point une API d'interrogation permettant de récupérer les données pertinentes pour une immatriculation, une compagnie aérienne etc.
- Mettre au point une notation des avions en fonction des environnements vus pendant leur vie et adaptable à tout type d'aéronef. Adapter cette notation aux aéroports.
- Analyser des retours en service d'une flotte, et documenter les résultats.
- Modéliser la susceptibilité à la corrosion en utilisant des techniques d'IA, et mettre à disposition le modèle via une interface.
- Analyser et mettre en valeur les leçons apprises.

CEA,"15-01-2025",Develop An Mlops Stack,Stage,Palaiseau,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/58322877.html,"In order to develop scene and text comprehension tools, the SIALV laboratory is developing a number of algorithms for different tasks. These different building blocks have historically been developed in different projects, which has led to compartmentalization between projects and difficulty in sharing knowledge. We would like to develop tools to develop a stack from the data curing to the deployment of machine learning models that are reliable and efficient.

During this internship, development can occur in various place of the MLOPS stack to :
- Train neural networks efficiently on multiple GPUs and multiple computational nodes for different vision and text tasks such as Generative AI (text and image), object detections, Named Entity Recognition (NER)...
- Deploy models internally to make predictions and evaluate models.
- Monitor our models.
- Store our large quantity of data.
- Maintain a model registry to track our experiments and easily deploy our best performing models.
- Visualize and annotate datasets containing multiple modalities (text, image, video, etc.) assisted by AI.
- Solutions to orchestrate, maintain and scale the technical infrastructure in our laboratory

You will also perform technological watch of MLOPS tools to find the best languages, libraries or frameworks to perform the missions mentioned above.

Aivancity,"14-01-2025",Alternancechef De Projet Ia Supply Chain,Alternance,Cachan,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/60570340.html,"Il bâtit les écosystèmes IA et data, tire parti des technologies IA et accompagne la transformation de la chaîne logistique de l'organisation.

Il construit une stratégie de rationalisation des processus de gestion des flux logistiques et d'amélioration des systèmes d'information en choisissant les parties prenantes et les outils.

Le chef de projet IA en supply chain réalise des audits, pose des diagnostics, définit les périmètres d'intervention et actionne les leviers logiques. Il dirige le pilotage opérationnel, gère le planning des projets IA et data, il suit la mise en place des nouvelles solutions et leur déploiement en respectant les coûts, les délais, l'éthique et les contraintes.

Pour garantir la transition technologique dans la supply chain, il sensibilise les collaborateurs aux enjeux et les forme sur les nouveaux process (qu'il s'agisse de gestion de flux physiques ou informatifs). C'est lui qui coordonne les équipes sur les différents sujets communs en faisant toujours le lien avec la direction générale.

Grâce à l'implémentation de l'IA et de la data, il modernise la chaîne logistique et transforme le schéma de la supply chain, pour agir sur la rapidité, l'adaptabilité, la fiabilité et l'efficacité.

La maîtrise des logiciels, outils informatiques et systèmes IA/data est nécessaire (ERP, TMS, WMS, EDI, machine learning, IOT, NLP/NLU, data science...). L'analyse des données complexes fait également partie des compétences clés de la fonction.

Le chef de projet IA en supply chain connaît les métiers et les procédés de la supply chain (S&OP, sales & operations planning, source d'amélioration du rendement, d'optimisation des ressources, des flux et des stocks). Il connaît aussi les métiers IA et data et organise l'interaction entre les différents experts autour de projets communs.

Bon communicant (en anglais et en français), il a un grand sens de la relation. Son sens du leadership l'aide à embarquer les équipes dans ses projets de transformation et d'amélioration continue.

Au sein du service, votre mission consistera à
- Mener les actions nécessaires pour régulariser les écarts dans nos systèmes d'information, en se basant sur les mesures faites par nos outils d'aide à la décision ou suite au signalement ou à la demande d'un acteur de la supply chain.
- Réaliser les actions de support aux flux nécessitant des rôles / droits plus élevés, tels que les réintégrations de stock.
- Participer à l'analyse causale de l'origine de l'écart, et proposer des modes de détection et/ou de correction préventive.
- (en fonction de vos compétences) Mettre en place les détections
Vous serez accompagnés et en support de 3 personnes expérimentées sur les différents systèmes, qui vous accompagneront dans la montée en connaissance.

Technicien supérieur expérimenté ou ingénieur, vous avez une formation en informatique ou data engineering. Idéalement, vous connaissez l'un des systèmes BaaN, REFLEX, SQL.
Vous faites preuve d'autonomie et de rigueur.
Une connaissance en Supply Chain et en méthodes de résolution de problème serait un plus.

Vos missions

MISSIONS GENERALES

L'objectif du poste est de réaliser un traitement statistique des données d'activité hospitalière et de contribuer au développement d'indicateurs pertinents afin de fournir aux personnels de direction et aux médecins les éléments d'analyse et de réflexion nécessaires à l'organisation de leur activité et à l'organisation des activités de recherche clinique (par exemple, fournir une liste de patients à inclure dans une étude rétrospective).

Plus spécifiquement, la Pitié-Salpêtrière a intégré l'échelle nationale des coûts (ENC). L'objectif de l'ENC est de produire des référentiels de coûts ou des valeurs nationales de coûts, c'est à dire des coûts moyens nationaux par type de prestation de soin réalisée par les établissements de santé. En intégrant l'ENC, nous aurons à disposition les coûts et les prestations sur l'hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière. La personne recrutée s'attachera plus spécifiquement à traiter ces données.

Présentation du service

L'AP-HP est un centre hospitalier universitaire CHU, qui s'organise en 6 GHU et 38 hôpitaux, traitant 8 millions de patients annuellement dans divers domaines médicaux. En tant que premier employeur d'Île-de-France, elle compte près de 100 000 professionnels. Elle assure un service de santé public 24/24. Pour en savoir plus : http://www.aphp.fr

La Direction des Services Numériques (DSN) de l'AP-HP fournit des services numériques aux patients et aux professionnels, dont le dossier patient, des systèmes pour la biologie et l'imagerie, et une offre bureautique sur plus de 70 000 postes. Elle fournit également des services pour la réutilisation secondaire des données de santé, au service du pilotage, de la recherche et de l'innovation, au travers de son entrepôt de données de santé.

L'équipe BNDMR a en charge deux projets majeurs :
- BaMaRa : un site web permettant le recueil des données de santé au travers d'une IHM web. Des connecteurs sont en place pour intégrer au fil de l'eau les données provenant des systèmes d'informations d'hôpitaux autres que l'APHP. Il s'agit d'un développement en continu assuré par une équipe de 8 personnes.
- L'entrepôt de données de santé BNDMR : une infrastructure logicielle composée de plusieurs outils donnant accès aux données de soins provenant de BaMaRa, une fois les traits d'identités retirés. Cet environnement est utilisé par une équipe de data scientists en interne, avec de manière ponctuelle des intervenants externes.

Vos missions

Dans le contexte d'une forte augmentation des demandes d'exploitation des données de la BNDMR, des accès permanents au Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS) et au Programme de médicalisation des systèmes d'information (PMSI national), et de la perspective d'appariement de cette base aux données de l'Assurance Maladie (SNDS), La BNDMR cherche à renforcer son équipe data afin de :
- Harmoniser et d'industrialiser ses process de préparation et d'exploitation des données de la BNDMR à des fins d'analyses statistiques ;
- Renforcer ses capacités à répondre aux projets et demandes d'analyse émanant des différents partenaires ; et
- Développer une cellule d'expertise sur les données du SNDS et du PMSI pour les maladies rares.

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Présentation du service

La Direction des Services Numériques (DSN) de l'AP-HP fournit les services numériques de l'institution aux utilisateurs, qu'ils soient patients ou professionnels. Avec plusieurs centaines de services numériques, comme le dossier patient informatisé, les systèmes de biologie et d'imagerie, l'espace patient, elle gère ses infrastructures et plus de 500 professionnels qui oeuvrent au quotidien pour la transformation numérique de l'institution.

Le pôle Innovation & données de la DSN, composé d'environ 120 personnes, propose une offre de services structurée autour de l'innovation numérique, l'entrepôt de données de santé de l'AP-HP, la bio-informatique et des maladies rares.

Zoom sur les données et l'EDS !

Les données collectées via le dossier patient informatisé permettent de constituer des bases de données pseudonymisées de grande envergure, ouvrant des perspectives pour la recherche en santé, l'innovation et le pilotage hospitalier.

L'AP-HP a été parmis les pionniers en créant en 2017 le premier entrepôt de données de santé (EDS) hospitalier autorisé par la CNIL, aujourd'hui le plus grand en Europe.

Pour renforcer son rôle et accélérer la recherche en santé grâce à son EDS, l'AP-HP a lancé le programme ACCES AP-HP, s'inscrivant dans la Stratégie d'accélération « Santé Numérique » du plan France 2030. Lauréate de l'appel à projet « Accompagnement et soutien à la constitution d'entrepôts de données de santé hospitaliers », l'AP-HP forme son équipe ACCES AP-HP !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.

Présentation du service

La Direction des Services Numériques (DSN) de l'AP-HP fournit les services numériques de l'institution aux utilisateurs, qu'ils soient patients ou professionnels. Avec plusieurs centaines de services numériques, comme le dossier patient informatisé, les systèmes de biologie et d'imagerie, l'espace patient, elle gère ses infrastructures et plus de 500 professionnels qui oeuvrent au quotidien pour la transformation numérique de l'institution.

Le pôle Innovation & données de la DSN, composé d'environ 120 personnes, propose une offre de services structurée autour de l'innovation numérique, l'entrepôt de données de santé de l'AP-HP, la bio-informatique et des maladies rares.

Zoom sur les données et l'EDS !

Les données collectées via le dossier patient informatisé permettent de constituer des bases de données pseudonymisées de grande envergure, ouvrant des perspectives pour la recherche en santé, l'innovation et le pilotage hospitalier.

L'AP-HP a été parmis les pionniers en créant en 2017 le premier entrepôt de données de santé (EDS) hospitalier autorisé par la CNIL, aujourd'hui le plus grand en Europe.

Pour renforcer son rôle et accélérer la recherche en santé grâce à son EDS, l'AP-HP a lancé le programme ACCES AP-HP, s'inscrivant dans la Stratégie d'accélération « Santé Numérique » du plan France 2030. Lauréate de l'appel à projet « Accompagnement et soutien à la constitution d'entrepôts de données de santé hospitaliers », l'AP-HP forme son équipe ACCES AP-HP !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.

Missions, équipe et environnement de travail, ça donne quoi ?

Dans un contexte de numérisation massive de la vie économique et d'augmentation significative du volume d'informations traitées par la banque, maîtriser les données produites et utilisées au sein de BNP Paribas est un objectif stratégique majeur pour le Groupe.

Le Group Data Office a pour mission d'accompagner les différentes priorités en matière de données du Groupe :
- Stratégie de données
- Qualité des données
- Protection des données
- Science des données

Au sein du Group Data Office, l'équipe COO est une équipe polyvalente et multiculturelle localisée à Paris et Madrid. L'équipe travaille en étroite collaboration avec le reste du Group Data Office et de la communauté Data au sens large dans l'ensemble du Groupe.

En tant que Stagiaire Data Project Manager Junior, vous aurez comme missions :
- Participer à la préparation des outils de communication (newsletters, plaquettes de présentation, site web, e-mailing, etc.).
- Conduire des benchmarks sur la base de données internes et externes.
- Participer à des projets sur la qualité des données et le déploiement du dispositif de contrôle autour de la donnée.
- Promouvoir une culture de transformation digitale et de respect des normes réglementaires au sein de la banque.
- Animer la communauté de collaborateurs et créer du contenu pour partager les avancées des projets IA, l'actualité et les interventions.
- Assister les équipes dans l'organisation d'événements internes dédiés à l'acculturation des collaborateurs sur les sujets Data et IA, avec des intervenants internes et externes.
- Aider dans la gestion de projets

Ce stage au sein du Group Data Office vous offrira l'opportunité de plonger au coeur des enjeux stratégiques liés à la data et à l'intelligence artificielle, au sein d'un environnement innovant et en pleine transformation.

En collaborant avec des experts de la donnée, vous développerez des compétences clés et pourrez explorer des perspectives professionnelles enrichissantes dans un domaine en pleine expansion.

Vos perspectives d'évolution ?

Votre passage au sein du Group Data Office vous permet de développer votre expertise et vos compétences techniques, mais également vos capacités de négociation, de travail en équipe, votre esprit de synthèse, tout en élargissant par ailleurs un réseau de relations avec les interlocuteurs du commerce.

D'autres opportunités pourront s'offrir à vous, favorisant votre insertion professionnelle : 
             -   Le Graduate Programme vous permet de booster votre avenir, de développer vos compétences et votre leadership grâce à des missions à responsabilité ;

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Leroy Merlin,"15/01/2025",Vendeur En Magasin,CDD,Brie-Comte-Robert,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/60594286.html,"Description du poste
Un poste pour celles et ceux qui aiment le commerce et les gens.

En tant que Vendeuse ou Vendeur, appelé chez nous Conseillère ou Conseiller de vente en magasin, vous êtes responsable de la satisfaction de votre client, et vous l'accompagnez dans la réalisation de son projet d'habitat.

Votre futur métier :

Au sein du rayon jardin, vous développez les ventes de votre rayon et contribuez à la performance du magasin. Comment ? En établissant une relation de qualité avec vos clients pour apporter à chacun la meilleure réponse à son besoin. Vous n'avez pas besoin d'être formé sur nos produits, nous nous en chargeons !

Vous êtes membre d'une équipe de vente, qui est animée sur le terrain par un Responsable de rayon et rattachée à un Manager commerce.

Vous travaillez ensemble sur la vente, la relation client et l'offre commerciale de votre rayon.

Vous prenez en charge les clients, les écoutez avec attention et cherchez à leur proposer les solutions les plus adaptées à leurs besoins.

Vous mettez les produits en valeur à travers des présentations inspirantes pour les clients.

Grâce à l'analyse de la data, vous identifiez les produits du catalogue Leroy Merlin à proposer à vos clients en magasin, et adaptez les réimplantations de votre rayon.

Vous garantissez la bonne tenue du rayon en assurant la disponibilité des produits, leur rangement, et la visibilité des prix.

Votre autonomie sera grande sur ce poste. Notre confiance aussi.

Nous vous formerons sur nos gammes de produits et nos méthodes. Ce qui compte pour nous, ce sont avant tout votre qualité d'écoute et vos valeurs !

Votre profil :
- Vous avez d'excellentes qualités relationnelles et aimez échanger avec les personnes,
- Vous faites preuve de curiosité, aimez comprendre, découvrir, vous informer, et trouver des solutions,
- Vous avez un tempérament commerçant, et vous aimez profondément la relation client,
- Une expérience de vente ou de conseil sera évidemment appréciée. Et dans le cas contraire, vous pourrez profiter de notre programme de formations !

Comment réussir sur ce poste :
- En participant activement aux projets collectifs et en proposant de nouvelles idées,
- En garantissant la qualité, la propreté et la sécurité de votre rayon,
- En allant chercher l'information, et en participant régulièrement aux formations produits,
- En apprenant à connaître vos clients, leurs enjeux, et leurs attentes.

Ce qui ne fonctionne pas sur ce poste :
- Chercher à vendre à tout prix ! Nous sommes là pour conseiller et satisfaire le client, en lui apportant la solution dont il a besoin avant tout.

Ce que vous retirerez de ce métier ?

Le plaisir de voir vos clients revenir grâce à la relation de confiance que vous aurez créée, et la satisfaction d'atteindre et même dépasser vos objectifs commerciaux.

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

QUI NOUS SOMMES ? 
 
Depuis plus de 150 ans, Nestlé met son savoir-faire au service de l'alimentation et s'est fixé le dessein ambitieux d'améliorer la qualité de vie et contribuer à un avenir plus sain. Guidés par ces valeurs, les 10 000 collaborateurs de Nestlé en France cultivent l'esprit pionnier d'Henri Nestlé, et contribuent tous les jours à l'amélioration des produits d'une centaine de marques connues et reconnues. 
 
La France est le 1er marché européen de Nestlé, le 3e dans le monde et 70% des matières premières utilisées dans ses usines sont françaises. Envie de rejoindre le premier pôle d'expertises agro-alimentaires, Place à l'action ! C'est maintenant. Pour aujourd'hui et pour demain 
 
Nescafé est née de la volonté de réaliser du café de la manière la plus simple possible, c'est-à-dire en y ajoutant de l'eau. Aujourd'hui, la catégorie Café est un véritable pilier du Groupe Nestlé, grâce à la production d'un café instantané qui conserve les saveurs naturelles du café. La gamme comprend les marques emblématiques comme Nescafé, Ricoré ou Nescafé Dolce Gusto. Plus récemment, nous avons lancé une nouvelle gamme de café en collaboration avec Starbucks. Les produits sont reconnus internationalement et vous pouvez les déguster dans 180 pays. En rejoignant les équipes de la catégorie Café, vous aurez la possibilité de travailler au sein d'une organisation européenne en pleine transformation ainsi que dans un environnement challengeant.

Le Crédit Mutuel : un employeur différent

Comment ? Par son organisation décentralisée qui fait de lui la seule banque coopérative non cotée en bourse de France. Ce qui compte d'abord au Crédit Mutuel, c'est la qualité de la relation avec nos clients qui sont les propriétaires de notre Groupe. Cet objectif fait du Crédit Mutuel la marque préférée des français dans le domaine bancaire depuis 14 ans.

Le Crédit Mutuel se singularise également par des valeurs qui constituent l'ADN de l'entreprise depuis plus de 130 ans : une forte autonomie au quotidien avec de réels pouvoirs de décision, de vraies responsabilités. Une entreprise dans laquelle exigence rime avec bienveillance, dans laquelle le mérite par la promotion interne est reconnu et qui offre de véritables perspectives de carrières.

Intégrer le Crédit Mutuel, c'est faire partie d'un collectif qui veut réinventer l'expérience client dans de nombreux domaines : la banque, l'assurance, la téléphonie, la location de véhicules ou de vélos, la commercialisation de biens immobiliers, l'informatique, la logistique... Autant d'activités dans lesquelles vos idées et vos compétences seront mises en valeur.

Rejoindre un Groupe fort de ses marques telles que Crédit Mutuel, CIC, la BECM, Cofidis, Euro Information..., c'est faire partie d'une aventure humaine et technologique dans laquelle vous prendrez toute votre place pour construire avec nous le monde de demain.

Axa partners,"11/03/2025",Data Scientist Analyst,Stage,Malakoff,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/62852685.html,"Nous recherchons un Data Scientist/Analyst H/F pour rejoindre la Direction Customer & Strategy d'AXA Partners, dans le cadre d'un stage de 6 mois.

Votre stage se déroulera au sein de l'équipe Customer Data, dont la mission est de transmettre la voix des clients au sein d'AXA Partners.

En vous basant sur notre riche ensemble de données, issues des dossiers de notre ligne de produits Automobile et sur les enquêtes expérience client', vous explorerez les facteurs ayant le plus grand impact sur la satisfaction client et quantifierez leur influence. De plus, nous souhaitons savoir si les facteurs clés varient selon différents sous-ensembles (par exemple, selon les années ou les types de dossiers) et identifier les anomalies qui ne correspondent pas aux attentes (par exemple, des cas où le service est excellent mais la satisfaction client reste faible, ce qui pourrait être considéré comme une anomalie) et les facteurs pouvant expliquer ces anomalies.

Objectif final :

Fournir à notre direction des informations opérationnelles et stratégiques cruciales pour améliorer la satisfaction client

Le stage suivra les grandes étapes d'un projet Data Science en entreprise (et sera affiné avec le tuteur + les responsables métiers au cours du stage).

Exploration & compréhension des données

a.      Comprendre la distribution, la définition et la qualité des données dans le contexte spécifique de l'entreprise

Bridge est une solution décisionnelle développée en interne pour consolider le chiffre d’affaires des clients qui ont investi dans des campagnes d’affichage sur l'ensemble des Business Units de JCDecaux, présente dans plus de 80 pays. 
Nos objectifs clés pour cette solution sont les suivants : 
Fournir aux directeurs commerciaux des différentes filiales des informations, des études et des alertes pour une meilleure gestion de leur portefeuille clients et la préparation des rendez-vous commerciaux. 
Produire des rapports Corporate sur les investissements destinés à la Direction Générale et à la communication financière externe. 
Actuellement, notre base de données Bridge compte 60 000 annonceurs, avec une croissance mensuelle de 1 500 à 2 500 nouveaux clients référencés. Cette base de données en constante évolution doit garantir une certaine qualité de l’information qualifiée, standardisée, consolidée. 
Missions :
Nous cherchons à recruter un(e) Assistant(e) Data Steward pour nous aider à qualifier les données et améliorer la consolidation de nos investissements. Les missions prioritaires de ce poste incluent : 

Une appétence pour l’actualité socio-économique des entreprises sur un plan international sera un véritable plus. Bien que le poste ne soit pas technique, il peut offrir la possibilité, dans un second temps, de monter en compétence dans la construction de rapports sous Excel connecté au cube de données, ainsi que de fiches clients rassemblant des informations publiques. 
Remarques :
Le collaborateur pourra compter sur le soutien de son manager pour suivre les procédures et les méthodes de traitement les plus appropriées. Un accompagnement sera prévu pour la prise en main des outils fournis, tels que Talend Data Stewardship et CapitalIQ.  
Pour optimiser le processus de qualification des données, une aisance dans l'utilisation de moteurs de recherche, ChatGPT ou la consultation de sites clients est requise. Il est important de noter que ces tâches sont davantage orientées vers la recherche et la collecte d'informations plutôt que vers une mise en œuvre technique.

Au sein du service, votre mission consistera à
• Mener les actions nécessaires pour régulariser les écarts dans nos systèmes d'information, en se basant sur les mesures faites par nos outils d'aide à la décision ou suite au signalement ou à la demande d'un acteur de la supply chain.
• Réaliser les actions de support aux flux nécessitant des rôles / droits plus élevés, tels que les réintégrations de stock.
• Participer à l'analyse causale de l'origine de l'écart, et proposer des modes de détection et/ou de correction préventive.
• (en fonction de vos compétences) Mettre en place les détections
Vous serez accompagnés et en support de 3 personnes expérimentées sur les différents systèmes, qui vous accompagneront dans la montée en connaissance.

JCDecaux,"14/01/2025",Assistant Data Steward Janvier ,Stage,Plaisir,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/60568413.html,"Contexte :

Bridge est une solution décisionnelle développée en interne pour consolider le chiffre d'affaires des clients qui ont investi dans des campagnes d'affichage sur l'ensemble des Business Units de JCDecaux, présente dans plus de 80 pays.

Nos objectifs clés pour cette solution sont les suivants :
- Fournir aux directeurs commerciaux des différentes filiales des informations, des études et des alertes pour une meilleure gestion de leur portefeuille clients et la préparation des rendez-vous commerciaux.
- Produire des rapports Corporate sur les investissements destinés à la Direction Générale et à la communication financière externe.

Actuellement, notre base de données Bridge compte 60 000 annonceurs, avec une croissance mensuelle de 1 500 à 2 500 nouveaux clients référencés. Cette base de données en constante évolution doit garantir une certaine qualité de l'information qualifiée, standardisée, consolidée.

Missions :

Nous cherchons à recruter un(e) Assistant(e) Data Steward pour nous aider à qualifier les données et améliorer la consolidation de nos investissements. Les missions prioritaires de ce poste incluent :
- L'attribution des secteurs d'activité à chaque client,
- L'amélioration des rattachements aux entreprises parentes,
- La contribution à la détection des marques concernées par les campagnes publicitaires.

- Une appétence pour l'actualité socio-économique des entreprises sur un plan international sera un véritable plus. Bien que le poste ne soit pas technique, il peut offrir la possibilité, dans un second temps, de monter en compétence dans la construction de rapports sous Excel connecté au cube de données, ainsi que de fiches clients rassemblant des informations publiques.

Remarques :

Le collaborateur pourra compter sur le soutien de son manager pour suivre les procédures et les méthodes de traitement les plus appropriées. Un accompagnement sera prévu pour la prise en main des outils fournis, tels que Talend Data Stewardship et CapitalIQ.
- Pour optimiser le processus de qualification des données, une aisance dans l'utilisation de moteurs de recherche, ChatGPT ou la consultation de sites clients est requise. Il est important de noter que ces tâches sont davantage orientées vers la recherche et la collecte d'informations plutôt que vers une mise en oeuvre technique.
- Un niveau d'anglais minimum est requis, étant donné que la qualification de données peut également impliquer la consultation de sites internet en anglais et en chinois traduit.

CEA,"15/01/2025",Apprentissage Par Transfert Pour Le Diagnostic De Câble Par Réflectométrie,Stage,Saclay,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/58322872.html,"Contexte
La réflectométrie est une méthode de diagnostic qui permet d'identifier et caractériser des défauts électriques sur des câbles ou plus généralement des lignes de transmission. Elle exploite les propriétés physiques de la propagation des ondes dans un milieu, et en l'occurrence un câble. En effet, lorsqu'on y injecte un signal approprié, les variations d'impédance dues à la présence d'un défaut provoquent la naissance d'un signal réfléchi qui peut être exploité pour détecter, localiser et caractériser le défaut. L'analyse de ces défauts permet d'améliorer la maintenance des câbles.
Afin de caractériser finement les défauts, il est nécessaire d'augmenter la bande passante du signal injecté, ce qui pose différents défis lorsque l'analyse doit être exécutée sur un système embarqué ayant des capacités computationnelles limitées.
Une réponse peut y être apportée en utilisant des modèles d'apprentissage automatique allégés et préalablement entraînés pour inférer la présence et les propriétés de défauts sans passer par une chaîne de traitements coûteuses en mémoire et en calculs.
Changement de distribution des données
Cependant, leur précision peut être garantie à condition que les données vues en phase d'inférence suivent la même distribution que les données vues en phase d'entraînement.
En pratique, plusieurs facteurs indépendants de la nature des défauts peuvent affecter la distribution des données : la longueur de câble, les différences de fabrication entre câbles de même type et de même longueur, le type de câble, les contraintes physiques auxquelles est soumis le câble, la fréquence du signal injecté ou encore l'encodage du signal réfléchi dans le convertisseur analogique numérique. De plus, en conditions opérationnelles, on ne dispose d'aucune ou de très peu de données annotées qui permettraient d'entraîner un nouveau modèle à partir de zéro.
L'objectif du stage sera d'évaluer l'impact de ces changements de distribution sur les performances des modèles de détection des défauts et de mettre en oeuvre des stratégies d'apprentissage par transfert permettant de le mitiger.

Déroulement du stage
Les travaux de stage se dérouleront en deux étapes décrites ci-dessous.

Étude exploratoire des variations distributionnelles selon leur origine
Il s'agira à l'aide de techniques de visualisation de caractériser qualitativement les changements de distributions des données dans  différents cas de figure : type de câble, longueur, compression, etc.
Mise en oeuvre et évaluation de trois stratégies d'adaptation de modèles
- Apprentissage avec augmentation de données
- Ré-entraînement partiel de modèle
- Adaptation de domaine
L'objectif sera de proposer une méthodologie qui permette d'obtenir le meilleur compromis entre précision de détection des défauts du modèle adapté et quantité de nouvelles données nécessaires pour l'adaptation du modèle.

Trimane,"12/03/2025",Data Engineering,Stage,Puteaux,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/62888220.html,"Présentation du sujet  : 
 
Contexte  : 
Le milieu sportif professionnel connait ces dernières années une révolution grâce à l'exploitation des données générées lors des matchs en permettant des analyses et des prédictions de performance toujours plus poussées. Face à ces nouveaux enjeux, de nombreux clubs professionnels souhaitent aujourd'hui mettre la data au coeur de leur projet de développement. Conscient de ce besoin, Trimane a commencé à développer en interne sa solution d'AMS (Athlete Management System) : Coach IQ. Dans un premier temps, Coach IQ a pour but d'offrir aux clubs une plateforme qui leur permettra de valoriser l'ensemble des données générées au sein du club (données en match, en entraînement, etc). Dans un second temps, l'application servira d'outil d'aide à la décision en mettant à disposition des clubs des modèles de Machine Learning pour la prédiction de performance, le recrutement etc.  
 
Descriptif  : 
L'objectif de ce stage est de participer aux développements de l'application en prenant part aux différentes composantes backend et frontend de l'application. La mission consistera d'abord à l'établissement des pipelines de données : récupération (IoT, fournisseurs de données externes), mise en forme et stockage dans notre base de données ainsi que mise à disposition pour la partie frontend et pour les algorithmes de Machine Learning de l'application. L'accent sera également mis sur le développement frontend de l'interface client afin de permettre aux utilisateurs de visualiser et manipuler les données transitant sur l'application.  
Pendant la durée de stage, ce sujet peut faire l'objet d'évolutions pour s'adapter aux contraintes de la société Trimane. En cas de modification importante, il sera soumis à l'approbation des parties signataires de la convention.   
 
Attendu  : 
Le stage étant principalement une mission de développement FullStack, l'attendu demandé est la mise en place de process fonctionnels pouvant être directement implémentés dans l'application existante.  
 
Environnement technique  : 
Afin de stocker l'ensemble des données, une base de données ElasticSearch est utilisée ainsi qu'une couche sémantique Cube. La partie frontend est développée avec Mendix (plateforme de développement low-code), ainsi qu'avec Flutter pour le développement de l'application mobile. Les processus de traitement et gestion des données sont principalement codés en Python.

CEA,"15/01/2025",Optimisation De La Détection D'émission Acoustiques Pour Le Suivi De La Santé Structurelle À L'aide,Stage,Saclay,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/58322886.html,"Contexte
La surveillance des infrastructures critiques telles que celles du secteur nucléaire ; du génie civil et de l'ingénierie pétrochimique, est essentielle pour garantir leur sécurité et leur intégrité. Elle peut se faire de manière dite passive au moyen des émissions acoustiques (EA) qui sont des ondes produites au sein de la structure par des événements tels que la formations de fissures ou des micro-frictions. Cette approche non intrusive permet une surveillance continue sans nécessité d'arrêts prolongés des opérations, et une détection précoce des anomalies réduisant le risque de défaillances catastrophiques.
La mise en oeuvre de la surveillance par émissions acoustiques présente cependant des challenges importants. Premièrement, les événements d'intérêt sont rares et souvent masqués par un bruit de fond important rendant la détection des formes d'onde recherchée complexe. De ce fait, la surveillance requiert généralement l'enregistrement d'une quantité importante de données ce qui entraîne de fortes contraintes matérielles pour le stockage et la transmission des signaux acquis.
L'objectif principal du stage sera de développer une méthode de segmentation embarquée de signaux de vibrations d'une structure mécanique afin de n'enregistrer que les segments de signaux contenant potentiellement des salves d'émissions acoustiques.
Déroulement du stage
Les travaux de stage se dérouleront en quatre grandes étapes décrites ci-dessous.
Acquisition de données expérimentales contrôlées
A l'aide de la plateforme du département dédiée au suivi de la santé structurelle, des émissions acoustiques seront simulées sur une structure expérimentale et les vibrations induites seront mesurées au moyen de capteur piézo-électrique et du carte d'acquisition dédiée.
Développement d'un modèle de détection d'émissions acoustiques
Une méthode précédemment développée pour la détection d'anomalie dans les séries temporelles sera évaluée, améliorée et adaptée au traitement de données en flux.
Portage sur cible matérielle
Il s'agira d'implémenter le modèle de détection sur la plateforme embarquée dédiée avec des contraintes de mémoire et de puissance. Cela inclut la quantification des paramètres du modèle, l'interfaçage avec l'environnement logiciel de la plateforme embarquée.
Evaluation de la robustesse
La robustesse du modèle face aux variations de distribution des données causées par les capteurs (par exemple un décollage) ou les changements du bruit ambiant sera évaluée et des pistes d'amélioration recommandée.

Safran,"14/01/2025",Suivi En Service Des Trains D'atterrissage Par Des Techniques D'ia,Stage,Vélizy-Villacoublay,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/60584637.html,"Les trains d'atterrissage sont des produits très peu communiquant, mais soumis à des conditions de fonctionnement très différentes en terme d'agressivité.
Afin de mieux comprendre et suivre leur utilisation en service, Safran Landing Systems s'intéresse aux possibilités de suivre à distance les avions équipés de ses produits.
Le stagiaire aura pour mission d'identifier et mettre en forme les données disponibles pour faciliter l'interrogation, analyser des retours en service, mettre en place des modèles pour différentes problématiques (par ex. corrosion).
Vous aurez en charge :
- Analyser les données disponibles et construire un dictionnaire de ces données (source, incertitude...).
- Mettre au point une API d'interrogation permettant de récupérer les données pertinentes pour une immatriculation, une compagnie aérienne etc.
- Mettre au point une notation des avions en fonction des environnements vus pendant leur vie et adaptable à tout type d'aéronef. Adapter cette notation aux aéroports.
- Analyser des retours en service d'une flotte, et documenter les résultats.
- Modéliser la susceptibilité à la corrosion en utilisant des techniques d'IA, et mettre à disposition le modèle via une interface.
- Analyser et mettre en valeur les leçons apprises.

CEA,"15/01/2025",Develop An Mlops Stack,Stage,Palaiseau,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/58322877.html,"In order to develop scene and text comprehension tools, the SIALV laboratory is developing a number of algorithms for different tasks. These different building blocks have historically been developed in different projects, which has led to compartmentalization between projects and difficulty in sharing knowledge. We would like to develop tools to develop a stack from the data curing to the deployment of machine learning models that are reliable and efficient.

During this internship, development can occur in various place of the MLOPS stack to :
- Train neural networks efficiently on multiple GPUs and multiple computational nodes for different vision and text tasks such as Generative AI (text and image), object detections, Named Entity Recognition (NER)...
- Deploy models internally to make predictions and evaluate models.
- Monitor our models.
- Store our large quantity of data.
- Maintain a model registry to track our experiments and easily deploy our best performing models.
- Visualize and annotate datasets containing multiple modalities (text, image, video, etc.) assisted by AI.
- Solutions to orchestrate, maintain and scale the technical infrastructure in our laboratory

You will also perform technological watch of MLOPS tools to find the best languages, libraries or frameworks to perform the missions mentioned above.

Aivancity,"14/01/2025",Alternancechef De Projet Ia Supply Chain,Alternance,Cachan,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/60570340.html,"Il bâtit les écosystèmes IA et data, tire parti des technologies IA et accompagne la transformation de la chaîne logistique de l'organisation.

Il construit une stratégie de rationalisation des processus de gestion des flux logistiques et d'amélioration des systèmes d'information en choisissant les parties prenantes et les outils.

Le chef de projet IA en supply chain réalise des audits, pose des diagnostics, définit les périmètres d'intervention et actionne les leviers logiques. Il dirige le pilotage opérationnel, gère le planning des projets IA et data, il suit la mise en place des nouvelles solutions et leur déploiement en respectant les coûts, les délais, l'éthique et les contraintes.

Pour garantir la transition technologique dans la supply chain, il sensibilise les collaborateurs aux enjeux et les forme sur les nouveaux process (qu'il s'agisse de gestion de flux physiques ou informatifs). C'est lui qui coordonne les équipes sur les différents sujets communs en faisant toujours le lien avec la direction générale.

Grâce à l'implémentation de l'IA et de la data, il modernise la chaîne logistique et transforme le schéma de la supply chain, pour agir sur la rapidité, l'adaptabilité, la fiabilité et l'efficacité.

La maîtrise des logiciels, outils informatiques et systèmes IA/data est nécessaire (ERP, TMS, WMS, EDI, machine learning, IOT, NLP/NLU, data science...). L'analyse des données complexes fait également partie des compétences clés de la fonction.

Le chef de projet IA en supply chain connaît les métiers et les procédés de la supply chain (S&OP, sales & operations planning, source d'amélioration du rendement, d'optimisation des ressources, des flux et des stocks). Il connaît aussi les métiers IA et data et organise l'interaction entre les différents experts autour de projets communs.

Bon communicant (en anglais et en français), il a un grand sens de la relation. Son sens du leadership l'aide à embarquer les équipes dans ses projets de transformation et d'amélioration continue.

Au sein du service, votre mission consistera à
- Mener les actions nécessaires pour régulariser les écarts dans nos systèmes d'information, en se basant sur les mesures faites par nos outils d'aide à la décision ou suite au signalement ou à la demande d'un acteur de la supply chain.
- Réaliser les actions de support aux flux nécessitant des rôles / droits plus élevés, tels que les réintégrations de stock.
- Participer à l'analyse causale de l'origine de l'écart, et proposer des modes de détection et/ou de correction préventive.
- (en fonction de vos compétences) Mettre en place les détections
Vous serez accompagnés et en support de 3 personnes expérimentées sur les différents systèmes, qui vous accompagneront dans la montée en connaissance.

Technicien supérieur expérimenté ou ingénieur, vous avez une formation en informatique ou data engineering. Idéalement, vous connaissez l'un des systèmes BaaN, REFLEX, SQL.
Vous faites preuve d'autonomie et de rigueur.
Une connaissance en Supply Chain et en méthodes de résolution de problème serait un plus.

Vos missions

MISSIONS GENERALES

L'objectif du poste est de réaliser un traitement statistique des données d'activité hospitalière et de contribuer au développement d'indicateurs pertinents afin de fournir aux personnels de direction et aux médecins les éléments d'analyse et de réflexion nécessaires à l'organisation de leur activité et à l'organisation des activités de recherche clinique (par exemple, fournir une liste de patients à inclure dans une étude rétrospective).

Plus spécifiquement, la Pitié-Salpêtrière a intégré l'échelle nationale des coûts (ENC). L'objectif de l'ENC est de produire des référentiels de coûts ou des valeurs nationales de coûts, c'est à dire des coûts moyens nationaux par type de prestation de soin réalisée par les établissements de santé. En intégrant l'ENC, nous aurons à disposition les coûts et les prestations sur l'hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière. La personne recrutée s'attachera plus spécifiquement à traiter ces données.

Présentation du service

L'AP-HP est un centre hospitalier universitaire CHU, qui s'organise en 6 GHU et 38 hôpitaux, traitant 8 millions de patients annuellement dans divers domaines médicaux. En tant que premier employeur d'Île-de-France, elle compte près de 100 000 professionnels. Elle assure un service de santé public 24/24. Pour en savoir plus : http://www.aphp.fr

La Direction des Services Numériques (DSN) de l'AP-HP fournit des services numériques aux patients et aux professionnels, dont le dossier patient, des systèmes pour la biologie et l'imagerie, et une offre bureautique sur plus de 70 000 postes. Elle fournit également des services pour la réutilisation secondaire des données de santé, au service du pilotage, de la recherche et de l'innovation, au travers de son entrepôt de données de santé.

L'équipe BNDMR a en charge deux projets majeurs :
- BaMaRa : un site web permettant le recueil des données de santé au travers d'une IHM web. Des connecteurs sont en place pour intégrer au fil de l'eau les données provenant des systèmes d'informations d'hôpitaux autres que l'APHP. Il s'agit d'un développement en continu assuré par une équipe de 8 personnes.
- L'entrepôt de données de santé BNDMR : une infrastructure logicielle composée de plusieurs outils donnant accès aux données de soins provenant de BaMaRa, une fois les traits d'identités retirés. Cet environnement est utilisé par une équipe de data scientists en interne, avec de manière ponctuelle des intervenants externes.

Vos missions

Dans le contexte d'une forte augmentation des demandes d'exploitation des données de la BNDMR, des accès permanents au Système National des Données de Santé (SNDS) et au Programme de médicalisation des systèmes d'information (PMSI national), et de la perspective d'appariement de cette base aux données de l'Assurance Maladie (SNDS), La BNDMR cherche à renforcer son équipe data afin de :
- Harmoniser et d'industrialiser ses process de préparation et d'exploitation des données de la BNDMR à des fins d'analyses statistiques ;
- Renforcer ses capacités à répondre aux projets et demandes d'analyse émanant des différents partenaires ; et
- Développer une cellule d'expertise sur les données du SNDS et du PMSI pour les maladies rares.

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Présentation du service

La Direction des Services Numériques (DSN) de l'AP-HP fournit les services numériques de l'institution aux utilisateurs, qu'ils soient patients ou professionnels. Avec plusieurs centaines de services numériques, comme le dossier patient informatisé, les systèmes de biologie et d'imagerie, l'espace patient, elle gère ses infrastructures et plus de 500 professionnels qui oeuvrent au quotidien pour la transformation numérique de l'institution.

Le pôle Innovation & données de la DSN, composé d'environ 120 personnes, propose une offre de services structurée autour de l'innovation numérique, l'entrepôt de données de santé de l'AP-HP, la bio-informatique et des maladies rares.

Zoom sur les données et l'EDS !

Les données collectées via le dossier patient informatisé permettent de constituer des bases de données pseudonymisées de grande envergure, ouvrant des perspectives pour la recherche en santé, l'innovation et le pilotage hospitalier.

L'AP-HP a été parmis les pionniers en créant en 2017 le premier entrepôt de données de santé (EDS) hospitalier autorisé par la CNIL, aujourd'hui le plus grand en Europe.

Pour renforcer son rôle et accélérer la recherche en santé grâce à son EDS, l'AP-HP a lancé le programme ACCES AP-HP, s'inscrivant dans la Stratégie d'accélération « Santé Numérique » du plan France 2030. Lauréate de l'appel à projet « Accompagnement et soutien à la constitution d'entrepôts de données de santé hospitaliers », l'AP-HP forme son équipe ACCES AP-HP !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.

Présentation du service

La Direction des Services Numériques (DSN) de l'AP-HP fournit les services numériques de l'institution aux utilisateurs, qu'ils soient patients ou professionnels. Avec plusieurs centaines de services numériques, comme le dossier patient informatisé, les systèmes de biologie et d'imagerie, l'espace patient, elle gère ses infrastructures et plus de 500 professionnels qui oeuvrent au quotidien pour la transformation numérique de l'institution.

Le pôle Innovation & données de la DSN, composé d'environ 120 personnes, propose une offre de services structurée autour de l'innovation numérique, l'entrepôt de données de santé de l'AP-HP, la bio-informatique et des maladies rares.

Zoom sur les données et l'EDS !

Les données collectées via le dossier patient informatisé permettent de constituer des bases de données pseudonymisées de grande envergure, ouvrant des perspectives pour la recherche en santé, l'innovation et le pilotage hospitalier.

L'AP-HP a été parmis les pionniers en créant en 2017 le premier entrepôt de données de santé (EDS) hospitalier autorisé par la CNIL, aujourd'hui le plus grand en Europe.

Pour renforcer son rôle et accélérer la recherche en santé grâce à son EDS, l'AP-HP a lancé le programme ACCES AP-HP, s'inscrivant dans la Stratégie d'accélération « Santé Numérique » du plan France 2030. Lauréate de l'appel à projet « Accompagnement et soutien à la constitution d'entrepôts de données de santé hospitaliers », l'AP-HP forme son équipe ACCES AP-HP !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Description de l'hôpital
L'Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) est un centre hospitalier universitaire à dimension européenne mondialement reconnu.
Ses 38 hôpitaux accueillent chaque année 10 millions de personnes malades : en consultation, en urgence, lors d'hospitalisations programmées ou en hospitalisation à domicile.
Elle assure un service public de santé pour tous, 24h/24, et c'est pour elle à la fois un devoir et une fierté.
L'AP-HP est le premier employeur d'Ile-de-France : 100 000 personnes - médecins, chercheurs, paramédicaux, personnels administratifs et ouvriers - y travaillent.

Au coeur de l'Institution, le Siège de l'AP-HP rassemble sous un même périmètre les directions fonctionnelles et les établissements qui lui sont rattachés :
CFDC (Centres de Formation et de Développement des Compétences), ACHAT (Achat Centraux Hôteliers Alimentaires et Techniques),
DRCI (Département de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation) et DSN (Direction des Services numériques).
Avec ses 4000 collaborateurs, le Siège assure un rôle d'expert, de pilote et de coordinateur pour l'ensemble des hôpitaux.

Engagée dans des projets novateurs et stratégiques au service des patients, l'AP-HP recherche aujourd'hui de nouveaux talents pour mener à bien sa mission.
Vous êtes l'un d'eux ? Venez nous rejoindre !

Votre stage se déroulera au sein de l'équipe Customer Data, dont la mission est de transmettre la voix des clients au sein d’AXA Partners.
En vous basant sur notre riche ensemble de données, issues des dossiers de notre ligne de produits Automobile et sur les enquêtes ‘expérience client’, vous explorerez les facteurs ayant le plus grand impact sur la satisfaction client et quantifierez leur influence. De plus, nous souhaitons savoir si les facteurs clés varient selon différents sous-ensembles (par exemple, selon les années ou les types de dossiers) et identifier les anomalies qui ne correspondent pas aux attentes (par exemple, des cas où le service est excellent mais la satisfaction client reste faible, ce qui pourrait être considéré comme une anomalie) et les facteurs pouvant expliquer ces anomalies.
Objectif final :
Fournir à notre direction des informations opérationnelles et stratégiques cruciales pour améliorer la satisfaction client
Le stage suivra les grandes étapes d’un projet Data Science en entreprise (et sera affiné avec le tuteur + les responsables métiers au cours du stage).

Seiki,"11/03/2025",Data Scientist,Stage,Paris 8e,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/62848784.html,"Seiki a identifié un réel pain point quant à la compréhension de la mobilité des populations : savoir précisément qui se déplace, où, quand, comment et pour quelle raison est difficile à mesurer, et encore plus à prévoir. Il est pourtant essentiel pour de nombreuses industries et secteurs de faire des choix raisonnés quant à ces problématiques.

La résolution de ce problème peut par exemple : 
- Permettre aux annonceurs de comprendre la dynamique de leur coeur de cible pour adresser le bon message au bon moment à la bonne personne. 
- Permettre aux retailers de choisir un emplacement stratégique en fonction des volumes de mobilité, de la saisonnalité, des groupes sociaux, du tourisme, des désertes de transports et d'autres spécificités d'une zone donnée. 
- Permettre une meilleure planification stratégique des transports, en examinant la situation existante, en identifiant les dysfonctionnements, en évaluant les effets des mesures potentielles (par exemple, la création d'une nouvelle ligne de transport public, la mise en oeuvre d'une route de contournement, etc.) en tenant compte de variables exogènes (évolution du prix du carburant, transfert d'un bassin d'emploi en un bassin de vie, changements démographiques et technologiques, préférences de la population locale aujourd'hui et dans le futur, etc.).

C'est pourquoi Seiki invente la Mobility Intelligence en France et à l'international. A l'effigie de la Business Intelligence, la MI est un nouveau processus technologique de modélisation et d'analyse des données des mobilités multimodales, afin d'accompagner trois verticales business que sont les médias, le retail / real estate et les smart-cities et de les aider à prendre des décisions stratégiques éclairées, en tenant compte de la réalité de la mobilité d'hier, d'aujourd'hui et de demain. Suite à une première levée de fonds après un peu plus d'un an d'existence, Seiki vit aujourd'hui un moment charnière, et cherche à renforcer son équipe technique avec un nouveau profil Data Scientist.

La division Mode 
 
La Mode est l'activité originelle de la Marque. Deux collections de Haute Couture, six collections saisonnières de Prêt-à-Porter et d'accessoires et deux collections capsules d'inspiration sportswear et lifestyle - Coco Beach et Coco Neige - proposent un style captant l'air du temps et s'inscrivent dans le quotidien des femmes. Une silhouette en mouvement et des accessoires constituent une part essentielle de l'allure de CHANEL et des codes intemporels de la Marque, immédiatement identifiables, imaginés par Gabrielle Chanel.

NESTLÉ,"11/03/2025",Promotion Manager & Business Analyst Nescafé,Stage,Issy-les-Moulineaux,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/62849087.html,"Nescafé est née de la volonté de réaliser du café de la manière la plus simple possible, c'est-à-dire en y ajoutant de l'eau. Aujourd'hui, la catégorie Café est un véritable pilier du Groupe Nestlé, grâce à la production d'un café instantané qui conserve les saveurs naturelles du café. La gamme comprend les marques emblématiques comme Nescafé, Ricoré ou Nescafé Dolce Gusto. Plus récemment, nous avons lancé une nouvelle gamme de café en collaboration avec Starbucks. Les produits sont reconnus internationalement et vous pouvez les déguster dans 180 pays. En rejoignant les équipes de la catégorie Café, vous aurez la possibilité de travailler au sein d'une organisation européenne en pleine transformation ainsi que dans un environnement challengeant.

NESTLÉ,"12/03/2025",Promotion Manager & Business Analyst Nescafé,Stage,Issy-les-Moulineaux,https://www.hellowork.com/fr-fr/emplois/62881788.html,"Nescafé est née de la volonté de réaliser du café de la manière la plus simple possible, c'est-à-dire en y ajoutant de l'eau. Aujourd'hui, la catégorie Café est un véritable pilier du Groupe Nestlé, grâce à la production d'un café instantané qui conserve les saveurs naturelles du café. La gamme comprend les marques emblématiques comme Nescafé, Ricoré ou Nescafé Dolce Gusto. Plus récemment, nous avons lancé une nouvelle gamme de café en collaboration avec Starbucks. Les produits sont reconnus internationalement et vous pouvez les déguster dans 180 pays. En rejoignant les équipes de la catégorie Café, vous aurez la possibilité de travailler au sein d'une organisation européenne en pleine transformation ainsi que dans un environnement challengeant.

Le microbiote intestinal, ce monde tant peuplé tant encore à découvrir. Nos microbes intestinaux ont un rôle clef dans le métabolisme des nutriments et une grande influence sur notre état de santé. Ils peuvent nous protéger de certaines maladies ou, au contraire, participer à leur survenue et leur progression. Comprendre leur fonctionnement et caractériser leurs fonctions métaboliques en cas de santé et de maladie est le défi de la recherche clinique des prochaines années.

Au sein de notre équipe, « Microbiota Twin », nous travaillons sur des technologies d'analyse et de modélisation de ces intéractions microbiote-hôte. En particulier, nous aimerions intégrer deux approches d'analyse couramment utilisées : les approches statistiques et les approches de modélisation métaboliques basées sur les contraintes. Nous voulons approfondir les méthodes déjà existantes et en développer des nouvelles pour construire des modèles d'association entre les prédictions in silico et les évidences in vivo.

Vos missions

Lors de ce stage, vous devrez concevoir une nouvelle méthode permettant d'analyser et interpréter les prédictions des modèles métaboliques sous contraintes avec les données in vivo. Vous travaillerez en étroite collaboration avec les ingénieurs de recherche de l'équipe Metabolic Twin ainsi que ceux du département Virtual Twin for Human.

Les étapes de travail suivantes devront être réalisées :
- Conduire une analyse de la littérature permettant d'étudier l'existant technique publié sur le sujet de la modélisation métabolique sous contrainte et les workflow d'analyse associés
- Reproduire l'état de l'art et élaborer une nouvelle méthode capable de répondre à ces besoins et formaliser cette solution en spécifications techniques
- Elaborer et implémenter une nouvelle méthode d'association entre les prédictions in silico et les évidences in vivo

Le microbiote intestinal, ce monde tant peuplé tant encore à découvrir. Nos microbes intestinaux ont un rôle clef dans le métabolisme des nutriments et une grande influence sur notre état de santé. Ils peuvent nous protéger de certaines maladies ou, au contraire, participer à leur survenue et leur progression. Comprendre leur fonctionnement et caractériser leurs fonctions métaboliques en cas de santé et de maladie est le défi de la recherche clinique des prochaines années.

Au sein de notre équipe, « Microbiota Twin », nous travaillons sur des technologies d'analyse et de modélisation de ces intéractions microbiote-hôte. En particulier, nous aimerions intégrer deux approches d'analyse couramment utilisées : les approches statistiques et les approches de modélisation métaboliques basées sur les contraintes. Nous voulons approfondir les méthodes déjà existantes et en développer des nouvelles pour construire des modèles d'association entre les prédictions in silico et les évidences in vivo.

Vos missions

Lors de ce stage, vous devrez concevoir une nouvelle méthode permettant d'analyser et interpréter les prédictions des modèles métaboliques sous contraintes avec les données in vivo. Vous travaillerez en étroite collaboration avec les ingénieurs de recherche de l'équipe Metabolic Twin ainsi que ceux du département Virtual Twin for Human.

Les étapes de travail suivantes devront être réalisées :
- Conduire une analyse de la littérature permettant d'étudier l'existant technique publié sur le sujet de la modélisation métabolique sous contrainte et les workflow d'analyse associés
- Reproduire l'état de l'art et élaborer une nouvelle méthode capable de répondre à ces besoins et formaliser cette solution en spécifications techniques
- Elaborer et implémenter une nouvelle méthode d'association entre les prédictions in silico et les évidences in vivo

Les principales activités incluent la mise à jour des véhicules, le fonctionnement des véhicules et la gestion des Événements Techniques. 
 
Pour cela, nous avons besoin d'outils permettant d'améliorer notre efficacité au quotidien. Nous avons commencé à mettre en place des jeux de données pour gérer les véhicules, les Événements Techniques, les versions logicielles, etc. Actuellement, nous avons lancé la création d'une suite d'outils, déjà utilisée par plusieurs utilisateurs en Europe, au Maroc, en Turquie et connue en Amérique du Nord. 
 
Votre objectif sera de contribuer au développement de la Suite d'Outils dans Foundry. 
Vous devez avoir une solide connaissance en Python et Typescript, ainsi qu'en gestion de Big Data. Vous serez amené à créer des tableaux de bord pour visualiser les données des jeux de données et offrir la possibilité de les compléter. 
 
Nous avons mis en place un processus pour les activités liées aux outils. Tout le développement sera réalisé selon la méthode agile, et une synthèse hebdomadaire des avancées de l'activité sera requise.

Esprit d'équipe, curieux, 
Niveau d'anglais : C1 
Excellente maîtrise de Python et TypeScript.

Missions/Activités
Votre mission consistera à cartographier et caractériser les bases de données utilisées et générées par les équipes d'INCEPTION (chez l'humain). L'objectif étant d'avoir une meilleure visibilité sur les sources de données pouvant avoir un intérêt pour INCEPTION et pour la communauté scientifique.

Votre mission concernera les actions suivantes :
- Définir les critères de caractérisation des bases de données : nature des données, quantification/volumétrie, type de base de données, mode de partage des données, conditions de réutilisation, point de contact, contraintes réglementaires et éthiques, démarches à effectuer pour réutiliser les données...
- Réaliser des entretiens avec les porteurs de projet INCEPTION pour recueillir les informations souhaitées,
- Analyser les publications et les plans de gestion des données pour identifier les bases de données citées,
- Analyser les caractéristiques des bases de données identifiées,
- Synthétiser les résultats sous forme de tableau, cette cartographie constituant le livrable principal du projet,
- Rédiger une synthèse sur les démarches à effectuer pour réutiliser les données provenant de ces bases de données.

Sur la base de cette cartographie, vous pourrez également être amené à formuler des recommandations sur les meilleures pratiques de partage de données humaines ainsi que sur les bases et entrepôts de données à prioriser pour le partage de données.

Pour cette mission, vous serez rattaché au Centre de Ressources en Information Scientifique (CeRIS) et vous collaborerez avec la Plateforme de Data Management, la Direction juridique, le Pôle de coordination de la recherche clinique.
Vous serez amené à être un·e interlocuteur·ice régulier·ère des équipes INCEPTION concernées par le projet de cartographie.

About us 
 
Cristóbal Balenciaga founded the House in 1917 in his home of Spain. In 1937, he established the brand in Paris, designing its collections there until 1968. Cristóbal Balenciaga had a reputation as a couturier of uncompromising standards and was referred to as ""the master of us all"" by Christian Dior and as The Couturier of the Couturiers by Gabrielle Chanel. The ultra-modern shapes were trademarks of the house. 
While the brand's identity is firmly rooted in its highly conceptual prêt-à-porter collections, its leather goods, footwear, and accessories experience worldwide success as well. Among the archetypal products of the House are its handbag collections. A new focus on the development of Balenciaga ready-to-wear collections for men was quickly established as highly successful. 
Since October 2015, Demna has designed both men's and women's collections as the artistic director. 
The Balenciaga House, part of the Kering group since 2001, is one of the most influential names in fashion.
